This project is a comprehensive guide to transitioning from LangChain (sequential, deterministic chains) to LangGraph (stateful, cyclic, and agentic workflows).

Below is the complete breakdown of the project architecture, file structure, and usage.

1. Project Conceptual Overview
The core of this project is building a Deep Research Assistant. Unlike a simple chatbot, this assistant uses a StateGraph to manage a complex lifecycle:

Nodes: Functions that perform specific units of work (searching, scraping, analyzing).

Edges: Transitions between nodes.

State: A persistent, shared memory (dictionary) that tracks the topic, URLs, content, and findings throughout the loop.

Conditional Routing: The ability to "loop back" and research more if the information gathered doesn't meet a quality threshold (e.g., a trustworthiness score < 75%).

2. File Structure & Directory Breakdown
The project is organized into Tasks, each introducing a new concept that builds toward the final Assistant.

Core Foundation (Tasks 1-3)
Task 1: Setup & Installation

Purpose: Installs langgraph, langchain, duckduckgo-search, and beautifulsoup4.

Task 2: Sequential vs. Stateful

sequential_chain.py: Demonstrates traditional LangChain where steps are independent (the model "forgets" Alice's name).

stateful_graph.py: Introduces the StateGraph. The model remembers data because it is stored in the shared TypedDict.

Task 3: State Accumulation

state_graph_demo.py: Shows a shopping cart example where nodes add to a list (Apple + Banana) rather than overwriting it.

Workflow Logic (Tasks 4-6)
Task 4: Nodes Demo

nodes_demo.py: Defines different types of nodes: Simple functions, LLM-powered nodes, and Tool-using nodes.

Task 5: Edges & Routing

edge_routing_demo.py: Implements Conditional Edges. It uses a "router" function to decide if the workflow should move to generate_report or more_research.

Task 6: Loops

loops_demo.py: Teaches how to prevent infinite loops using an iterator counter while allowing the agent to refine its search keywords.

The Final Build (Tasks 7-9)
Task 7: Tool Integration

tools_demo.py: Connects the graph to the real world using the DuckDuckGo Search tool (DDGS).

Task 8: Memory Management

memory_demo.py: Specifically handles how to synthesize multiple search results into a "Knowledge Base" without losing intermediate data.

Task 9: The Research Assistant

research_assistant.py: The full CLI application combining all previous tasks.

streamlit_app.py: A web-based UI that visualizes the research progress in real-time.

3. The Shared State (The "Brain")
In LangGraph, the State is a class that defines what the agent remembers. In this project, the state looks like this:

Python
class ResearchState(TypedDict):
    topic: str               # The original search query
    remaining_urls: list     # Links found but not yet scraped
    current_url: str         # The link currently being processed
    content: str             # Raw text from the webpage
    current_score: int       # Trustworthiness score (0-100)
    facts: list              # Accumulated factual statements
    report: str              # The final synthesized output
4. Usage: How to Run the Project
Step 1: Environment Setup
Install the necessary dependencies:

Bash
pip install langgraph langchain_openai duckduckgo-search beautifulsoup4 streamlit
Step 2: Testing Memory (Task 2)
Run the comparison to see why LangGraph is better for context:

Bash
python task_2/stateful_graph.py
Step 3: Running the Full Assistant (CLI)
To start a deep research session on a topic (e.g., "Tesla Earnings Call"):

Bash
python task_9/research_assistant.py
What happens: The agent will search, score sources, reject those below 75%, and loop until it has enough data to write the report.

Step 4: Running the Web Interface (Streamlit)
For a visual experience with progress bars and charts:

Bash
streamlit run task_9/streamlit_app.py
